The browser should then display the web page titled New Visions For Public Schools along with my name, from here please view console to see the desirerd output for the functions described in the performance Task.

Additional Details:

The first function outputs an object of the students ordered by Grade, and in each grade they are also ordered alphabetically, as this was assumed from the example output given in the directions.

The second function outputs the students with the lowest average for each grade, and in the case that there is more than one student with the lowest grade, it will display all the students that have the lowest grades, and this is apparent in the console output.
